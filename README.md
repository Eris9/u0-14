# u0-14
A guide for unc0ver on IOS 14

# Stability
As u0 is not too stable this is a troubleshooting guide

# Respring loop
Reboot and re-jailbreak with no tweaks enabled
Find a faulty tweak which you just installed and uninstall it

# Random resprings
1. reboot and try again
2. If that doesn't work, try re-jailbreaking with no tweaks and follow #respring loops

# Rebooting after installing
Try rejailbreaking and don't install many tweaks at once, install them one by one

# Not jailbreaking, error codes?

If this is after a successful jailbreak then restore root-fs and rejailbreak

# Unable to boot with no tweaks
This means that your jailbreak setup has crashed, please restore root fs

# How to restore root fs
Open unc0ver, settings, tick restore root fs, exit settings click jailbreak. This might take sometime. Try around 4 times for best success

# Bootloop
Put your device in DFU
